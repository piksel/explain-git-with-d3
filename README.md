# explain-git-with-d3
### Forked from [onlywei/explain-git-with-d3](https://github.com/onlywei/explain-git-with-d3)
#### Changes:
 - Added missing d3.js so that the demo works correctly
 - Updated this readme to point to updated demo

Use D3 to visualize simple git branching operations.
This simple project is designed to help people understand some basic git concepts visually.
This is my first attempt at using both SVG and D3. I hope it is helpful to you.
